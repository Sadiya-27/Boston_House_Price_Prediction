## XGBoost Regressor

## üåü What is XGBoost Regressor?
- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced, efficient implementation of gradient boosting for supervised learning tasks like regression and classification.
- The XGBoost Regressor is specifically designed to predict continuous numerical values (e.g., house prices), and it is known for its:
  - High performance
  - Speed
  - Scalability
  - Accuracy

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does It Work?
XGBoost builds a series of decision trees sequentially, where:
- Each new tree tries to correct the errors made by the previous trees.
- Instead of predicting the final target directly, each tree predicts the residuals (errors) of the previous predictions.
- The final prediction is the sum of the predictions from all trees.
- This is called gradient boosting, because the model learns by minimizing a loss function using gradient descent.

## üìà Key Features

| Feature                   | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Boosting Algorithm**    | Combines many weak learners (small trees) to create a strong model. |
| **Regularization**        | Prevents overfitting by using L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties.  |
| **Handling Missing Data** | Smart handling of missing values during training.                   |
| **Parallel Processing**   | Fast training using multiple CPU cores.                             |
| **Tree Pruning**          | Uses a depth-first approach and prunes trees for optimal size.      |
| **Custom Loss Functions** | You can define your own objective functions.                        |

## üß™ Why Use XGBoost for Regression?
- Outperforms many other models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests) on structured/tabular data.
- Works well even with nonlinear relationships between features and target.
- Offers strong tools to tune performance using hyperparameters like max_depth, learning_rate, n_estimators, etc.

## How It Works
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74bbbe55-ed70-40ee-9aa4-5b27bbacfcd7)

Here‚Äôs a more detailed look at how XGBoost works:
1. Initial Prediction:
   XGBoost starts by making a simple prediction on the training data, often using the average of the target variable.
Error Calculation: It then calculates the residuals, which are the differences between the predicted values and the actual values in the training data. Essentially, these residuals represent the errors in the initial prediction.

2. Building the First Decision Tree:
   XGBoost builds the first decision tree in the ensemble. This tree focuses on learning these residuals, aiming to minimize the overall error. To do this, the algorithm finds the best split points in the features that will reduce the errors the most.
   
3. Subsequent Trees and Error Correction:
   Here‚Äôs where the magic of gradient boosting happens. XGBoost doesn‚Äôt discard the previous tree. Instead, it uses the residuals again, but this time for the predictions made by the entire ensemble so far (including the first tree). The new tree specifically targets these remaining errors, further improving the model‚Äôs accuracy.
   
4. Minimizing Loss Function:
   Throughout the process, XGBoost optimizes a loss function. This function mathematically measures how well the model‚Äôs predictions match the actual values. By minimizing the loss function, XGBoost ensures the ensemble is on the right track to make accurate predictions.
   
5. Stopping Criteria:
   XGBoost adds trees until a certain stopping criteria is met. These criteria could be a maximum number of trees, a minimum improvement in the loss function, or reaching a certain level of accuracy.

## üìò Example: Understanding How XGBoost Works (Simplified)

Let‚Äôs consider a toy dataset with one feature (`RM` - number of rooms) and corresponding house prices.

### Dataset

| RM (x) | Price (y) |
|--------|-----------|
| 4      | 200       |
| 5      | 250       |
| 6      | 300       |
| 7      | 350       |

---

### Step 1: Initial Prediction

Start with the mean of `y` as the initial prediction:

**Initial Prediction (f‚ÇÄ):**
y_mean = (200 + 250 + 300 + 350) / 4 = 275


| x | Actual y | f‚ÇÄ(x) | Residual = y - f‚ÇÄ(x) |
|---|----------|-------|----------------------|
| 4 | 200      | 275   | -75                  |
| 5 | 250      | 275   | -25                  |
| 6 | 300      | 275   | +25                  |
| 7 | 350      | 275   | +75                  |

---

### Step 2: Train Tree on Residuals

**Tree 1 Logic (simple):**
- If RM ‚â§ 5 ‚Üí output = -50  
- If RM > 5 ‚Üí output = +50

---

### Step 3: Update Predictions

**Learning rate (Œ∑) = 0.1**

**Updated Prediction (f‚ÇÅ):**
f‚ÇÅ(x) = f‚ÇÄ(x) + Œ∑ * Tree‚ÇÅ(x)

| x | f‚ÇÄ(x) | Tree‚ÇÅ(x) | f‚ÇÅ(x) |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 4 | 275   | -50      | 270    |
| 5 | 275   | -50      | 270    |
| 6 | 275   | +50      | 280    |
| 7 | 275   | +50      | 280    |

---

### Step 4: Compute New Residuals

| x | y | f‚ÇÅ(x) | New Residual |
|---|---|--------|--------------|
| 4 | 200 | 270  | -70          |
| 5 | 250 | 270  | -20          |
| 6 | 300 | 280  | +20          |
| 7 | 350 | 280  | +70          |

Repeat this process with new trees and residuals to refine the predictions further.

---

### üîÅ Final Model (after n trees):

f(x) = f‚ÇÄ(x) + Œ∑ * tree‚ÇÅ(x) + Œ∑ * tree‚ÇÇ(x) + ... + Œ∑ * tree‚Çô(x)

This example demonstrates the core idea behind **gradient boosting** used in **XGBoost**.
